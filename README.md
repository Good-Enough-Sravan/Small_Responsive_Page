# Small_Responsive_Page
# Project Title
I literally don't know what to write in this file but I know this file will be written professionally in future.


## Appendix
I think I have done pretty well using my current skills.
Please feel free to suggest any changes and improvements in this.

Thank You..

This project was made from the challenge given by Kevin Powel in his course https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts



## What I learned from this project.
* I started coding using mobile-first layout format from this project.
* Innitially everything was good but here comes the first problem when strted creating fixed nav bar responsively.
* I used clamp function for font sizes but Innitially I am not pretty sure about this function.
* For the first time I wrote lot of CSS that I did't imagined in my innitial learning days.
* I learned creating hamburger menu using only HTMl and CSS (also I have gone through some YouTube references).
* I improved in creating Flex and Grid layouts.
* There more media querries used in this project than my previous ones but It helped me to make the website more responsive.
* I learned restricting the content to stop growing on larger screens by max-width.
* Also learned button transitions, nav-bar transitons, writing proper HTMl code etc.,
